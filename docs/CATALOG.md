# Chimera Catalog — Best Templates & Models (2026)

Curated, locally-runnable models per modality, chosen on **quality and fitness for
the task** — licensing is not a selection factor here (use is personal). The License
column stays as neutral reference for anyone who forks; flags (✅ commercial-OK ·
⚠️ restricted · ❓ verify) describe terms, they don't gate choices.

> **Start here:** ComfyUI ships a built-in **Templates Library** (sidebar →
> categories) with one-click reference workflows for most of these. Use those as
> your starting point, then move customized copies into `workflows/personal/`.

> **Mid-2026 freshness note:** Z-Image, LTX-2.3, ACE-Step 1.5 XL, TRELLIS.2, and
> HunyuanVideo-Foley are all post-Jan-2026 releases. Verify ComfyUI node/version
> compatibility (smoke-test) before pinning any of them. Speed and quality claims
> for these models are largely vendor-stated or single-source — treat as directional
> until independently confirmed. Third-party node packs must be security-scanned
> before adoption (same standard as the MCP bridge).

## 🖼️ Image (text-to-image)

**Recommended default (mid-2026): Z-Image — Brand Kits pipeline default**

Z-Image is ComfyUI core-native (support added in 0.22.3 — **no custom node
pack**), uses a **Qwen-3-4B text encoder loaded via `CLIPLoader(type="lumina2")`
— not the CLIP/T5 stack** — and runs well under 16 GB VRAM. It produces
noticeably better faces than FLUX.2 at lower VRAM cost. The Brand Kits `image`
module dispatches to Z-Image templates when the active model name starts with
`z_image`; it falls back to the FLUX.2 templates for any `flux2*` model name.

| `ae.safetensors` *(shared)* | `Comfy-Org/z_image_turbo` | `vae/` | ~0.3 GB | ✅ Apache-2.0 |

- **Z-Image turbo** (`z_image_turbo_nvfp4`) — 8-step / CFG 1.0 fast path.
  Default for `txt2img` and `logo` modes in Brand Kits.
- **Z-Image base** (`z_image_bf16`) — 25-step / CFG 4.0, full fidelity. Default
  for `product` img2img (always) and for `txt2img`/`logo` when `--variant base`
  is passed.
- **Variant pairing is strict** — the model file, step count, and CFG are
  co-determined; do not mix them.
- The Qwen-3-4B text encoder replaces the CLIP/T5 stack used by earlier models.
  Load via `CLIPLoader(type="lumina2")`.

**Secondary / Brand Kits fallback: FLUX.2 [dev]**

Pass `--model flux2_dev_fp8mixed.safetensors` (or set `defaults.model` to a
`flux2*` name in `brand.yaml`) to route the Brand Kits `image` subcommand
through the FLUX.2 templates instead.

**Other secondary / fallback picks**

| Model | Strengths | VRAM (quantized) | License |
|-------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **FLUX.1 [dev]** | Excellent quality & text; huge LoRA ecosystem | 7–8 GB (FP8) / 24 GB | ⚠️ non-commercial |
| **FLUX.1 [schnell]** | Fast, 1–4 step | ~8 GB | ✅ Apache-2.0 |
| **Qwen-Image (2512)** | Best multilingual text, editing, fast 8-step LoRA | ~12–16 GB | ✅ commercial-friendly |
| **SDXL / Juggernaut XL** | Mature ecosystem, tons of LoRAs | 6–8 GB | ✅ OpenRAIL |
| **SD 3.5** | Solid all-rounder | ~8–12 GB | ❓ check community license |

**Upscaler — Brand Kits image `--upscale` default**

|------|-----------------|----------------------------------|---------|
| `4x-UltraSharp.pth` | `lokCX/4x-Ultrasharp` | `upscale_models/` | ❓ verify (repo lists it; neutral reference) |

- **4x-UltraSharp (ESRGAN)** — the default 4× upscaler for `generate.py image
  --upscale`. Spliced before `SaveImage` via `ImageUpscaleWithModel`; ESRGAN
  auto-tiles, so 1024²→4096² fits a 32 GB card. Override with `--upscale-model`
  or `defaults.upscale_model`. SUPIR (below) is the heavier, higher-fidelity
  alternative when a single image warrants it.

## ✂️ Image editing / control
- **Qwen-Image-Edit** — object insert/remove, style transfer, inpainting. ✅
- **ControlNet** (pose / depth / canny / normal) — structural control.
- **IP-Adapter** — reference a style or subject image.
- **Inpaint / Outpaint** nodes — fix or extend.
- **Upscale:** Real-ESRGAN, 4x-UltraSharp, **SUPIR** (heavy, gorgeous).

## 🎬 Video (text-to-video / image-to-video)

**Recommended default (mid-2026): LTX-2.3 22B**

Node pack: `https://github.com/Lightricks/ComfyUI-LTXVideo` — **pinned at audited
commit `229437c`** (re-scan before advancing the pin). Provides MultimodalGuider,
normalizing sampler, 2-stage spatial upscaler nodes, and IC-LoRA support — install
via ComfyUI-Manager, then `git checkout 229437c`, before using the models below.

| File | HuggingFace repo | Destination (`ComfyUI/models/…`) | Size | License |
|------|-----------------|----------------------------------|------|---------|

- **Dev nvfp4** (`ltx-2.3-22b-dev-nvfp4`) — quantized for 32 GB cards; primary
  daily-driver path.
- **Distilled** (`ltx-2.3-22b-distilled-1.1`) — fewer steps, higher throughput at
  full weight; only practical on 32+ GB.
- **Distilled LoRA** — **must be v1.1** to match the v1.1 spatial upscaler; v1.0
  LoRAs are incompatible.
- **Spatial upscaler** (`ltx-2.3-spatial-upscaler-x2-1.1`) — the 2× latent
  upscaler for `generate.py video --upscale`. Spliced before the VAE decode via
  `LTXVLatentUpsampler` (loaded by `LatentUpscaleModelLoader`), so it upscales in
  **latent space** — temporally coherent, unlike a per-frame ESRGAN pass.
  Override with `--upscale-model`. Use `x2-1.1`, not `x2-1.0`; version must match
  the LoRA.
- **Text encoder** — reuse the already-installed `gemma_3_12B_it_fp4_mixed`
  (`text_encoders/`). **Never use the node pack's cloud `GemmaAPITextEncode`**;
  always point to the local Gemma encoder.
- **LTX-2 LoRA incompatibility:** LoRAs trained on LTX-2 (19B) are **not**
  compatible with LTX-2.3; retrain or source LTX-2.3-native LoRAs.

**Secondary / fallback picks**

| Model | Strengths | Notes | License |
|-------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **LTX-2 19B dev-fp8** *(already validated)* | Audio-video (synced sound), up to 4K/50fps/20s, RTX-optimized | Solid fallback; existing LoRAs work here | open weights |
| **Wan 2.2 14B** | Strong motion realism, Apache-2.0 | t2v + i2v | ✅ Apache-2.0 |
| **HunyuanVideo 1.5** | High-fidelity motion | t2v / i2v | ❓ verify |
| **FramePack F1** | Long video on modest VRAM | efficient | open |
| **AnimateDiff** | Legacy but flexible | stylized loops | open |

> **Wan 2.5 / 2.6 / 2.7 are API-only** — disqualified for local use. Use Wan 2.2
> if you want the Wan family for its motion realism.

**For live-stream stingers/transitions:** LTX-2.3 dev-nvfp4 (speed + quality) or
the already-validated LTX-2 path for synced audio-video. Wan 2.2 with Lightning
LoRAs is a strong second for pure-motion clips.

---

## 🗣️ Talking head / avatar
- **LongCat 1.5 Avatar** — talking-head from audio + image.
- **LTX-2 / LTX-2.3** — audio-video can carry lip-sync.
- (Useful for stream intros, animated mascot/host segments.)

---

## 🔊 Audio — synced foley (video → sound)

**Recommended default (mid-2026): HunyuanVideo-Foley**

Strong video-to-audio foley at 48 kHz, with a Synchformer dependency that
time-aligns the generated audio to on-screen motion. Security-scanned; node pack
pinned at audited commit `afd2960` (safe-with-precautions — Chimera's graph uses
only 3 of the pack's registered nodes, `HunyuanModelLoader` /
`HunyuanDependenciesLoader` / `HunyuanFoleySampler`; never run the bundled
`cli.py` / `infer.py` / `gradio_app.py` scripts, which carry a
`torch.load(weights_only=False)` pickle-RCE). Re-scan before advancing the pin.

**Fallback:** LTX native AV (built into LTX-2 / LTX-2.3) — zero extra install,
works offline. **MMAudio is demoted to secondary fallback** (HunyuanVideo-Foley
benchmarks higher per the independent arXiv evaluation).

## 🎵 Audio — standalone music / stingers

**Recommended default (mid-2026): ACE-Step 1.5 XL Turbo**

ComfyUI core-native (no extra node pack); 8-step turbo, KSampler euler, cfg 1.0.
Generates instrumental stingers/loops from genre/style tags; supports lyrics, voice
cloning, and remix. Output: `.mp3` (SaveAudioMP3, V0).

**Secondary / fallback picks**

| Model | Strengths | License |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **ACE-Step (base)** | Proven, MIT, ~4 min music | ✅ MIT |
| **HeartMula** | Offline songs from lyrics + style tags, multilingual | open (Jan 2026) |
| **Stable Audio 3.0** | SFX + music, native ComfyUI support | ⚠️ check Stability license |

**For streaming:** great for intro/outro stings and background beds — pick the model
that sounds best for the cue (licensing isn't a constraint for personal use).

## 🧊 3D (image-to-3D)

**Recommended default (mid-2026): Hunyuan3D 2.1 — Brand Kits pipeline default**

Hunyuan3D 2.1 is **ComfyUI 0.22.3 core-native** — no custom node pack, no
gated model dependencies. One `.safetensors` checkpoint bundles the DiT shape
model, a DINOv2 CLIP-Vision encoder (ungated), and the 3D VAE. Takes a single
image and produces a high-detail geometry mesh (~421 K verts / ~1.1 M tris at
`octree_resolution 256`, valid glTF-v2 GLB). **Shape-only in the native path**
— the output has no PBR textures/materials (geometry only; downstream texturing
in Blender etc. works normally). In-pipeline PBR texturing (Hunyuan3D-Paint) is
**deferred on the Blackwell / cu130 / torch 2.10 stack**: it needs a compiled
`custom_rasterizer`, and every prebuilt wheel targets cu126/torch2.6 (or cu129/
torch2.8), none ABI-compatible with torch 2.10 — and no CUDA Toolkit (`nvcc`) is
present to compile `sm_120` from source. See [`modules/threed/README.md`](../modules/threed/README.md#why-in-pipeline-pbr-texturing-is-deferred-on-this-stack)
for the texturing routes (Blender/Substance, or a cu126 env) and the re-visit path.

| `hunyuan_3d_v2.1.safetensors` | `Comfy-Org/hunyuan3D_2.1_repackaged` | `checkpoints/` | ~7.4 GB | ⚠️ Tencent community license — verify before commercial use |

- Bundles DiT + DINOv2 CLIP-Vision (ungated) + 3D VAE in a single file.
- `--octree` (default `256`) trades geometry detail vs file size:
  `256` ≈ ~1.1 M tris / ~18 MB GLB; `128` ≈ lighter preview mesh.
- `--free-before` defaults ON; peak fits a 32 GB card.

> **Hunyuan3D 3.0 reminder:** API/cloud only (paid "Partner Nodes") — **not**
> the free local path. Use **2.1** for free local generation.

**Secondary: TRELLIS.2 4B — higher ceiling but wheel-bound**

TRELLIS.2 produces high-quality PBR-textured meshes from a single image and is
the stronger output when texturing matters. Currently listed as secondary
because its prebuilt Windows CUDA wheels target **Python 3.11 / PyTorch 2.7–2.8
/ CUDA 12.8** — incompatible with the reference setup (py3.12 / torch2.10 /
cu130). Building from source requires a separate CUDA 12.8 toolchain. Also has a
**gated dependency** (`facebook/dinov3-vitl16-pretrain-lvd1689m`) that requires
HF license acceptance + `hf auth login`. Upgrade path when wheel compatibility
catches up.

- HuggingFace repo: `microsoft/TRELLIS.2-4B` (whole repo, ~16 GB)
- Destination: `models/trellis2/` (preserving `ckpts/`, `pipeline.json`,
  `texturing_pipeline.json` sub-structure)
- Node pack: `https://github.com/visualbruno/ComfyUI-Trellis2`
- Gated dep: `facebook/dinov3-vitl16-pretrain-lvd1689m` — HF license accept +
  `hf auth login` required; model download returns 401 otherwise
- VRAM: ~16 GB (whole repo loaded)
- License: ❓ verify — conflicting sources; do not rely on any single claim

## 🧠 LLM / agent layer
- **Local (via Ollama):** Qwen 3.6, Gemma, Llama, GLM — for prompt expansion,
  JSON workflow parameterization, and VLM critique loops.
- **API node:** Gemini (e.g. 3.1 Flash-Lite) is supported by the built-in LLM node.
- **Quantized loading:** `ComfyUI-GGUF` to fit large models in VRAM.

**Agent / VLM judge (self-correction loop): Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct**

The vision judge for the **local standalone** self-correction backend (generate →
judge → refine). Run as a ComfyUI graph via the
[`1038lab/ComfyUI-QwenVL`](https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-QwenVL) node pack —
security-scanned, **pinned at commit `fcd1ada`** (SAFE-WITH-PRECAUTIONS; re-scan before
advancing the pin). Weights from the **official Qwen repo only**. See
[`../modules/agent/self-correction.md`](../modules/agent/self-correction.md).

The judge graph also writes the verdict text to disk with the **core** ComfyUI node
`SaveImageTextDataSetToFolder` (`comfy_extras.nodes_dataset`, `experimental`) — this is
**core, not an extra pack** (unlike the third-party QwenVL pack above), so it needs
**ComfyUI ≥ 0.24.x** rather than an install. The QwenVL pack remains the only
third-party dependency for this backend.

| File / repo | HuggingFace repo | Destination (`ComfyUI/models/…`) | Size | License |
|------|-----------------|----------------------------------|------|---------|
| Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` | `LLM/Qwen-VL/` | ~15 GB (FP16) | ✅ Apache-2.0 (verify) |

- FP16 ≈ **15 GB VRAM** — fits a 32 GB card alongside an image model. A smaller VL
  variant is the natural fallback on lighter cards (judging quality drops accordingly).
- The **assistant Workflow** backend needs no model — it judges with the assistant's
  own vision (multi-judge consensus); this VLM is only for the unattended local path.
