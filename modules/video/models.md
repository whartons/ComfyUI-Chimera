# Video module — models

LTX-2.3 22B is a **multimodal checkpoint** that generates video and synchronized
48 kHz audio in a single pass. It requires the
[`ComfyUI-LTXVideo`](https://github.com/Lightricks/ComfyUI-LTXVideo) custom-node
pack for its `MultimodalGuider`, normalizing sampler, and spatial-upscaler nodes.

Download the files below from Hugging Face and drop each into the matching
`ComfyUI/models/...` folder. Filenames must match the ones in
[`workflow.template.json`](workflow.template.json) (or edit the template to match
what you downloaded).

### What each file does

- **`ltx-2.3-22b-dev-nvfp4`** — the primary checkpoint; nvfp4-quantized for 32 GB
  cards. This is the daily-driver path. Load via the pack's `LTXVCheckpointLoader`
  or `CheckpointLoaderSimple`.
- **`ltx-2.3-22b-distilled-lora-384-1.1`** — the distilled-step LoRA that pairs
  with the nvfp4 checkpoint to reduce the required number of sampling steps.
  **Must be v1.1** — v1.0 was trained against an older model revision and is
  incompatible with the v1.1 upscaler.
- **`ltx-2.3-spatial-upscaler-x2-1.1`** — a 2× latent spatial upscaler. Wired
  into the opt-in `--upscale` pass (an `LTXVLatentUpsampler` spliced before the
  VAE decode — temporally coherent, see the README). Loaded by
  `LatentUpscaleModelLoader`. **Use the x2-1.1 file** — version must match the
  distilled LoRA.
- **`gemma_3_12B_it_fp4_mixed`** — LTX-2.3's text encoder (Gemma-3 12B). Load
  via **`LTXAVTextEncoderLoader`** (in-graph, local). **Never use the node pack's
  cloud `GemmaAPITextEncode` node** — that sends text to an external endpoint.

## Required node pack

| | |
|---|---|
| **Repo** | `https://github.com/Lightricks/ComfyUI-LTXVideo` |
| **Audited commit** | `229437c` — **pinned** (never `@latest`); re-scan before advancing the pin |
| **Install** | Clone into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`, then `git checkout 229437c`, then `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| **Setup.py** | None — cloning the repo runs no code; only `pip install` executes the pack's Python |
| **Security** | Scan before adoption and on every update (same standard as the MCP bridge). Verdict for the reviewed revision (`229437c`): safe for local use — **with the two exclusions below** |

### Excluded nodes (do not use)
- **`GemmaAPITextEncode`** — sends prompts to a Lightricks cloud endpoint. Use
  `LTXAVTextEncoderLoader` (local Gemma) instead.
- **Prompt-enhancer node** — sets `trust_remote_code=True` when loading the
  enhancer model. Avoid unless you have independently audited that model.

## Caveats

- **LTX-2 LoRA incompatibility:** LoRAs trained on LTX-2 (19B) do **not** work
  with LTX-2.3 (22B). Source or retrain LTX-2.3-native LoRAs.
- **Wan 2.5 / 2.6 / 2.7 are API-only** — disqualified for local use; use Wan 2.2
  if you want the Wan family.
- **Post-Jan-2026 models:** LTX-2.3, the distilled LoRA, and the spatial upscaler
  are all recent releases. Smoke-test before pinning to a version, and re-scan the
  node pack before advancing its pin.
- **LoRA version matching:** the distilled LoRA and the spatial upscaler are
  version-paired — always use the same suffix (`-1.1` with `-1.1`).

## Faster / lighter variants (optional)

- **Full distilled checkpoint** (`ltx-2.3-22b-distilled-1.1.safetensors`,
  `checkpoints/`, ~46 GB) — fewer sampling steps at full fp16 weight; only
  practical with 32+ GB VRAM and if you need maximum output quality without
  the nvfp4 quantization. See `Lightricks/LTX-2.3` on Hugging Face.
- **GGUF quantized** — if VRAM is tight, check the community for GGUF variants
  loadable via `ComfyUI-GGUF`; note audio generation quality may degrade under
  heavy quantization.
