# Self-correction loop — generate → judge → refine

The self-correction loop turns Chimera from "**generate once**" into "**iterate to a
passing result**": render a candidate, judge it against a brand/brief rubric, feed the
unmet criteria back into the prompt, regenerate — until a candidate passes or a
max-iteration cap is hit. It is the orchestration layer that sits on top of Brand Kits
generation, distinct from the [MCP bridge](README.md) (which is the assistant→ComfyUI
transport).

## The shared core — `scripts/agent/`

A small, **model-free, judge-agnostic** core (unit-tested with no GPU/ComfyUI). It
reuses the existing `scripts/generate.py` filler/route path. Only the **winning**
render is recorded — with an *agent-run* sidecar (`kind: agent-run`) summarizing the
run (subject, iterations, pass/score, winning seed/prompt). That sidecar is a run
summary, **not** a replayable render sidecar: `generate.py replay` refuses it on the
`kind` discriminator. Per-iteration renders are routed into the brand folder but are
not individually sidecar'd, so the loop is **not** per-iteration replayable.

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `rubric.py` | `Rubric` + `build_rubric(manifest, subject)` — composes a scorable checklist from the brand (subject, style, palette, negative). `rubric.as_prompt()` renders the numbered **MET / NOT-MET → PASS/FAIL → `score: 0-1`** instructions a judge follows. |
| `expander.py` | `PromptExpander` ABC + `TemplatedExpander` — wraps `build_prompt(manifest, subject)` for the on-brand `(positive, negative)`; given `prior_issues`, appends `". Emphasize and correct: <issues>"` so the next render corrects them. |
| `judge.py` | `Verdict(passed, score, issues)` + `Judge` ABC (`judge(image_path, rubric) -> Verdict`) + `parse_verdict(text)` — a robust free-text → `Verdict` parser (word-boundaried PASS/FAIL, clamped score, NOT-MET lines → issues; never raises). |
| `loop.py` | `run_loop(*, expander, judge, generate, manifest, subject, rubric=None, max_iters=4, seeds=None) -> LoopResult` — the heart. Judge-agnostic: `generate` and `judge` are **injected callables**. Threads prior issues forward; returns early on PASS, else the best-scoring candidate after the cap, with full per-iteration history. |

The judge's **PASS/FAIL verdict is authoritative** for stopping the loop — a single
PASS returns immediately. The `score` is *not* a threshold gate; it is used only to
**rank candidates** when the iteration cap is reached and the loop returns the
highest-scoring one. A mid-iteration render/judge failure is caught and recorded as a
failed candidate (score `0.0`, no image), so one bad iteration never aborts the run and
a failed candidate can never win.

The two pluggable seams are the **`Judge`** interface (how a candidate is scored) and
the **`PromptExpander`** interface (how a subject + prior issues become a prompt).
Everything else — the rubric, the loop, the generate path — is shared by both backends
below. `TemplatedExpander` is the V1 expander; an LLM-driven expander is a documented
future extension, not built.

## The two backends

Both drive the *same* core; they differ only in **who plays the `Judge`**.

| | **Assistant Workflow** | **Local standalone** |
|---|---|---|
| Judge | The assistant's own vision — **M independent passes, majority-PASS consensus** | A single **Qwen2.5-VL-7B** judge node |
| Driver | Claude Code's Workflow/subagent tooling (assistant in the loop) | Headless CLI: `scripts/agent/auto_generate.py --backend local` |
| Quality | **Highest** — multi-judge consensus catches subtle failure modes | Good — one strong VLM pass per candidate |
| Cost / deps | No API key, no extra model | ~15 GB VRAM VLM, fully **offline/unattended** |
| Status | **Built** (proven live; see recipe) | **Built + validated** (full loop ran live) |
| Recipe | [`../../workflows/agent/README.md`](../../workflows/agent/README.md) | `scripts/agent/auto_generate.py` |

**When to use which:**

- **Assistant Workflow** — highest-quality, subtle-correctness briefs (anatomy,
  layout, counts, "no X"), when you can keep the assistant in the loop. The multi-judge
  consensus is the strongest available filter. Recipe + the proven chimera-anatomy
  precedent: [`../../workflows/agent/README.md`](../../workflows/agent/README.md).
- **Local standalone** — unattended batches, scheduled jobs, or fully **offline** runs
  with no assistant present. Trades a touch of judging quality for autonomy.

### Multi-judge consensus — `ConsensusJudge`

The majority-vote consensus above is now a concrete, judge-agnostic `Judge`:
[`scripts/agent/judge.py`](../../scripts/agent/judge.py)'s `ConsensusJudge` wraps **N sub-judges**
and combines them — `passed` = a strict majority passed, `score` = the mean, `issues` = the
de-duplicated union of every sub-judge's unmet criteria (so the expander addresses *all* raised
concerns on the next iteration). A sub-judge that raises counts as a fail rather than crashing the
panel. The diversity comes from the judges you pass in (different VLMs/prompts, or an assistant
panel) — all behind the same `Judge` seam, so it drops straight into `run_loop`. Unit-tested in
[`tests/test_consensus.py`](../../tests/test_consensus.py).

### Local backend

> **Status: built + live-validated.** The full generate → judge → refine loop has run
> end-to-end: a Z-Image render judged by Qwen2.5-VL-7B against the auto-built brand
> rubric, returning `passed=True score=0.97`.

The local backend runs the **same** `run_loop` with a `Qwen2.5-VL` judge node in place
of the assistant's vision — see `scripts/agent/auto_generate.py`. The judge is
**Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct** run **as a ComfyUI graph** (the same queue/`ComfyClient`
path every Chimera modality uses): `LoadImage → Qwen2.5-VL(prompt = rubric.as_prompt())
→ text`, then `parse_verdict()` turns that text into a `Verdict`. The expander is the
same deterministic `TemplatedExpander`, so a local run is brand-aware without any
assistant or API key.

**Invocation:**

```
python scripts/agent/auto_generate.py --brand <brand> --subject "<subject>" \
    --comfy-output-dir <ComfyUI output dir> [--max-iters N] [--seeds a,b,c]
```

`--comfy-output-dir` does double duty: it's both where finished renders route into the
brand folder **and** where the judge graph drops (and the judge reads back) its verdict
`.txt`.

### The judge & correction in action (real local-backend output)

The rubric is **strict** (overall PASS only if *every* criterion is MET) and asks the judge to attach
a structured fix to each miss — `FIX: add <…>; avoid <…>`. The expander consumes that directly:
`add` terms are emphasized in the next positive prompt; `avoid` terms are **stripped from the subject**
in the positive (Z-Image zeroes the text negative, so the positive is the real lever) and also pushed
to the negative for models that honor it (FLUX.2). See `scripts/agent/expander.py`.

**The judge evaluates every criterion and emits an actionable fix.** Verbatim from Qwen2.5-VL-7B on an
`example-brand` rover render:

```
1. MET — six wheels arranged in two rows of three, providing stability typical of military vehicles…
2. MET — robustly built with sharp angles consistent with industrial designs…
3. NOT-MET  FIX: add subtle highlights reflecting light off metallic surfaces;
            avoid overly smooth textures that might suggest plastic models rather than real metal
4. MET — dominant colors match those specified (#1c1f22, #2e3338)…
5. MET — clear details, no blurring…
```

That `FIX: add … ; avoid …` is exactly what the expander turns into the next prompt.

**It enforces the brand.** Given a deliberately off-brand *"glossy orange plastic toy rover,"* the
strict judge rejects it (and explains why), where the old lenient pass-bar would have rubber-stamped it:

```
NOT-MET — a playful, childlike appearance that aligns more closely with "toy-like" than with
          rugged tactical-industrial / precise engineering themes.
NOT-MET — lacks the specified palette colors like #1c1f22 …
Overall: FAIL   score: 0.7
```

…versus an on-brand render the same judge passes at **0.95–0.97**.

**Honest note on convergence.** Z-Image's base quality plus the brand prompt injection are strong
enough that a *satisfiable* subject usually passes on the **first** iteration — so a dramatic
multi-iteration fail→pass is the exception, not the rule. The correction machinery is what engages
when a render genuinely misses, and its reliability scales with the judge: the local 7B follows the
structured-fix format *intermittently*, so a more capable judge (a larger local VLM, or the attended
[assistant panel](#the-two-backends)) sharpens both the strict verdict and the fix directives. The
value the strict-rubric + structured-FIX design adds is that the loop now *enforces* the brand instead
of accepting a render that misses it.

**How the verdict is captured:** the judge graph
(`workflows/templates/agent-vlm-judge.json`) runs Qwen2.5-VL via the
`AILab_QwenVL_Advanced` node and writes its text output to disk with the **core**
ComfyUI node `SaveImageTextDataSetToFolder` (`comfy_extras.nodes_dataset`), which lands
`agent_verdicts/<prefix>_00000.txt`; `LocalVLMJudge` reads that file (run-unique prefix,
brief retry for the FS flush) and feeds it to `parse_verdict()`. That save node is
`experimental` and ships in core ComfyUI — it is **not** a separate node pack — so it
requires **ComfyUI ≥ 0.24.x** (the QwenVL node pack remains the only third-party
dependency).

- **Model:** `Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` — FP16 ≈ **15 GB VRAM**, placed in
  `models/LLM/Qwen-VL/` (catalogued in [`../../docs/CATALOG.md`](../../docs/CATALOG.md)).
- **Node pack:** [`1038lab/ComfyUI-QwenVL`](https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-QwenVL),
  installed and **security-audited this session** — verdict **SAFE-WITH-PRECAUTIONS**,
  **pinned at commit `fcd1ada`**. Re-scan before advancing the pin.

**VRAM / perf:** the 7B judge at FP16 fits a 32 GB card alongside an image model with
room to spare, but judging adds a VLM load + inference per candidate, so a multi-seed
batch is meaningfully slower than a plain generate. For lighter cards, a smaller VL
variant is the natural fallback (judging quality drops accordingly).

**Security posture:** weights come from the **official Qwen repo**
(`Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct`) only; the node pack is **pinned** (no `@latest`) at the
audited commit, consistent with the rest of Chimera's third-party-code policy (same
standard applied to the [MCP bridge](README.md) and the foley pack). Re-audit before
any pin bump.
